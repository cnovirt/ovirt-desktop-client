[ovirt]
; url: You oVirt infrastructure API URL. If you're using oVirt version 3.6.x,
;      URL should be somewhat like: `https://myovirt.mydomain.com/api`. If
;      you're using oVirt version 4.0.x or greater, URL should be somewhat
;      like: `https://myovirt.mydomain.com/ovirt-engine/api`.
url = https://ovirt.yourdomain.com/api

; cafile: Since oVirt 4.x, including the certificate of the oVirt instance
;         is mandatory. For that, you have to take and export your oVirt
;         certificate (you can do this connecting with your web browser to
;         your URL and saving the certificate). It doesn't matter whether the
;         CA is self-signed or not: Since oVirt 4.x this parameter is
;         mandatory.
cafile = /your-ovirt-project/ca.crt

; domain: The domain under which your users will authenticate. When you create
;         an AAA authenticator (LDAP, Kerberos, ...), a domain name is created
;         to match it. This value goes here, so users will authenticate as
;         'username@domain' (Ex: LDAP, MyCompany, ...). It's the 'Profile'
;         field value when you're logging into the oVirt web-based API.
domain = LDAP

[app]
; lang: Chooses the application language. Available languages are stored under
;       the 'lang' folder. If you don't see your language, you can translate it
;       and send a push request so I can merge it into the project. Default: en.
lang = en

; connection_timeout: Establishes the number of seconds to wait after sending a
;                     request to your oVirt infrastructure after which the
;                     request will be considered timed out. Default: 15.
connection_timeout = 15

; preferred_protocol: Some VMs have more than one graphics protocols enabled
;                     (i.e, VNC and SPICE) at a time. These VMs allow choosing
;                     which one you prefer to use when opening a console window.
;                     In case that the VM only has one protocol enabled, this
;                     will be used disregarding this parameter. Possible values:
;                     spice, vnc. Default: spice
preferred_protocol = spice

; fullscreen: Enables opening the console window as fullscreen or the default
;             size. Possible values: 1 (full screen), 0 (default size). Default: 0
fullscreen = 0

; allow_remember: Defines whether show or not the "Remember credentials" checkbox.
;                 Some environments might prefer not enabling it (for example,
;                 thin-client fashioned terminals). Possible values: 1 (enable the
;                 remembering credentials checkbox), 0 (disable the remembering
;                 credentials checkbox). Default: 1
allow_remember = 1

; autologout: Time in minutes of idleness after which the session is forcibly closed.
;             If set to 0, the autologout feature is disabled. Only works if there
;             are not any credentials stored (also with allow_remember = 0), which
;             is incompatible with this feature. Default: 0
autologout = 15

; notify_autologout: The time before 'autologout' in minutes before a warning window
;                    will be shown to the user alerting them about an imminent forced
;                    logout event. Accepting the warning means resetting the idle
;                    time. This setting needs to have a lower value than 'autologout'.
;                    If this setting is set and 'autologout' is not, or if the value
;                    of 'notify_autologout' is lower than the value in 'autologout',
;                    this setting will be set to the default value. A value of 0
;                    means that no warning windows will be shown to the user.
;                    *Example*: If 'autologout' is 15 and 'notify_autologout' is 5,
;                    means that 5 minutes before reaching the 15 minutes limit of
;                    idleness a warning window will be shown. If the user accepts the
;                    warning within the next 5 minutes limit, the idleness count will
;                    be reset. Otherwise the enforced logout will be performed.
;                    Default: 0
notify_autologout = 5

; remote_viewer_path: The path to the remote-viewer binary. By default, it's set to
;                     the path that is compatible with most systems. However, you can
;                     set a customized path here. If set to an invalid path, the app
;                     will still try to find the correct binary. Will exit if no
;                     suitable binary was found. Default: /usr/bin/remote-viewer
remote_viewer_path = /usr/bin/remote-viewer
